# Sinatra
new sinatra gem
Sinatra is a singer

This is obvious

But it's also a Gem ! Who would have thought that we'd be using this sweet-oh-sweet crooner's name to... well develop web apps and "BDDs" as the french call them.
Anyway, that being said, i'm glad you're here to witness our craftmanship as we built, brick after brick, this web interface witch allows you - bear with me here - to GOSSIP !

What a world we live in.

So glad we got to grab THP's CEO's hands as they (or maybe just that good old Felix-the-cat person) walked us through this maze of page-linking, CSV-editing, nail-clipping, ERB-discovering, and therefore life-changin experience.
Not to get carried away but we did learn a LOT, but not quite as much as we would have wanted.
The interface, not sexy as it is, is stil functional, and we hope you'll enjoy clicking on it as much as we had a litteral BLAST translating our brains farts into code.

Best regards,

Us
